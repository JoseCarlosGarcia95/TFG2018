	This work tries to introduce fuzzy logic theory, and search new concepts related with the conception of fuzzy analysis theory with the objective of find a concept for fuzzy differential equations.  The fundamental pillars on which this theory is based lie in the power of Zadeh's extension principle, fuzzy numbers, and over every different arithmetic operation defined over fuzzy numbers. \\ \\
	By some regularity conditions not too restrictive, you can find a relationship between solving a fuzzy differential equation and solving an ordinary differential equation, this theoretical framework, invites and accompanies build numerical methods based on classical numerical methods that are known worldwide. \\ \\
	This work also introduces some models that can be built taking into account the fuzzy nature of real life. \\ \\
	Finally, this work also involves high performance computational techniques, to achieve the best energy performance and in a matter of time. And it will be seen, that high-performance computational techniques can change the results of tests quite remarkably.

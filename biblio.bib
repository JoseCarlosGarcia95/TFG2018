By considering a suitable generalization of the Hausdorff metric, we derive the Lebesgue-dominated convergence type theorem."

abstract = {A Daniell-Stone type characterization theorem for Aumann integrals of set-valued measurable functions will be proven. It is assumed that the values of these functions are closed convex upper sets, a structure that has been used in some recent developments in set-valued variational analysis and set optimization. It is shown that the Aumann integral of such a function is also a closed convex upper set. The main theorem characterizes the conditions under which a functional that maps from a certain collection of measurable set-valued functions into the set of all closed convex upper sets can be written as the Aumann integral with respect to some σ-finite measure. These conditions include the analog of the conlinearity and monotone convergence properties of the classical Daniell-Stone theorem for the Lebesgue integral, and three geometric properties that are peculiar to the set-valued case as they are redundant in the one-dimensional setting.},
